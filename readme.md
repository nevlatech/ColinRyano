## Installation

Download it using Package Control.

## Usage

Place comma-seperated values in your view. At the bottom or top add 'sx:' followed by the name of the snippet you'd like to use. Make sure there are newlines between the data you want manipulated and anything else. Hit Alt+x. 

Note that any regular sublime snippet can be used. Nothing special has to be added to make this work.
